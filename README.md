# E2FLoRa

Edge2FLoRa is a simulation framework based for carrying out end-to-end simulations for Edge2LoRa networks.

It is based on the [FLoRa (Framework for LoRa)](http://flora.aalto.fi/), an [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) network simulator module for standard LoRa & LoRaWAN Networks. Moreover , it uses components from the [INET framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) as well.
